    Changed game icon for the one with 8 fruits + omega sphere
    Added copy-paste in levels
    Splitted level informations between fields and infos
    Added transformations for copies (not all, though)

    Order of fruit collecting
    Enum for order kind
    Having images of sizes different from the ones loaded
    Orders have images instead of something textual now

    Some new transitions
    Corrected a bug on the obtention of a transition (previously, the transition of a level was obtained before it was deployed)
    Allowed to create longer transitions
    Also added the transformations mentioned above

    A true pause menu with relevant information (spawn spaces + teleports)
    Reviewed buttons : match_parent for horizontal alignment. For the "Précédent Redémarrer Suivant" trio I actually resized the texts in them...

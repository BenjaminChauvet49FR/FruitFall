    Sticky bombs

    Corrected a bug from the previous commit : making a valid swap between a nut and a fruit didn't cause the fruits to be collected, only the nut to disappear
    Realigned text of waiting nuts + changed gap for levels with orders
    Drawed animation of nut disappearing

    Cleared warning here and there

    Corrected animation of Omega sphere (fruits disappearing and reappearing after an omega sphere)
    Changed philosophy around omega spheres ! Now, omega animation is something different. (notably, mitigated the hijacking in GTH by adding a new list for animations + added in GH the "afterOmegaStasis")

    Fixed a bug of hostage locks and (L+Omega) or (F+Omega) : the hostage lock was morphed (thanks to a =) into a special virtual fruit and that was it !

    Corected a bug of the spaces where some fruits weren't blasted (virtual lightning, virtual fire, fire ; doesn't concern lignthing because of the for loop... for now)
    Philosophy on special fruits and collecting : a coloured fruit is collected on fruit special creation AND on fruit special activation ! (centered in blast to allow collection of virtual special fruits first, even though real special fruits are collected too...)

    Tried to handle simply colours, but not that easy !
